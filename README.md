## Site home

Site Home is an Opera port of a Safari extension that adds a toolbar button designed to take you to the current website’s start (aka. home) page. Original [Safari version](http://deepitpro.com/en/articles/SiteHome/info/) by _Deep Informational Technologies._

The extension will override the Open History Panel keyboard shortcut (Windows only), Control–h, for it’s own purposes. Supported on all platforms.

Run `make` to package it as an Opera extension and open the resulting _site-home.oex_ file with Opera. Or drag the _config.xml_ file on top of an Opera window to install it in developer mode.
